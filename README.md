# Taxi-driver-app

## Target persona
Traditional taxi drivers, not like uber drivers that have efficient and clear app to record their trips and income. Sometimes they have to deal with cash payment so that samll change can may messed thing up or it is inconvenient to record every trip on paper like what Japanese taxi drivers do. Not only because steering wheel is not a place for writing, but also a lot of time can be saved if trip data can be automatically got from taxi meter which is what this app aim to do. 

## Extensiniliy
Taxi Company can extent their service to online pre_order. Online database system is able to organize more orders at the same time. Also, It is possible to add Navigater mode into the app so that drivers do not have to switch between different apps. Based on machine learning model, the app can give sugestions like where to pick up next passenger more puickly or more profitably. Last but not least, if necessary, the app may contain a hidden command to sent out the drivers' SOS signal.
